##  Project Overview
This project presents a **comprehensive Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard** designed to analyze and optimize the performance of a **multi-national property management and sales operation**.  
The dashboard offers insights into **financial performance, sales channels, geographical revenue, and client profiles**, helping decision-makers transition from reactive management to **data-driven strategic planning**.

---

##  Objectives
The main objectives of this BI project were to:

- **Maximize Revenue & Income:** Identify key drivers of revenue growth and profitability across properties.  
- **Optimize Sales Strategy:** Determine the most effective **sales channels** (Broker, Direct, Online) and **property types** (Condo, Single Family, Apartment, Townhouse).  
- **Identify High-Value Markets:** Highlight the top **revenue-generating countries** and their associated **client demographics**.  
- **Improve Operational Stability:** Study monthly sales patterns to mitigate volatility and ensure consistent cash flow.

##  Problem Statement
The property management firm lacked a clear, data-backed understanding of its global operations. Key challenges included:

1. **Lack of Granularity:** Difficulty identifying which property types, channels, or locations contributed most to performance.  
2. **Volatile Sales:** Unpredictable month-to-month fluctuations impacting forecasting accuracy.  
3. **Client Targeting Issues:** Inefficient marketing spend due to limited insight into high-value client segments.

This dashboard resolves these issues by providing actionable insights across sales, revenue, expenses, and client behavior.
